# Inte-R-active Environmental Science

In recent years, the potential of interactive web tools to share information is increasingly recognized and used in the scientific community. Researchers need to further harness this potential and develop easy accessible online tools that can be used in- and outside the scientific community to explore, learn, teach and communicate environmental issues. This repository stores code of a Shiny dashboard that provides an overview of scientifically engineered interactive tools developed by environmental scientists in Potsdam/Berlin using R. 

# Further tools, models, packages,...

Furthermore, we provide a compilation of interesting tools, models, packages,...engineered by environmental researchers in Potsdam/Berlin not only based on R, but using Python, Matlab,...

# Contributions and modifications

To view the current version of the dashboard, download this respository and run the Shiny dashboard on your local machine. An online version that is infrequently updated is available:

Should you know about further interesting tools not yet included into the overview, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are happy to include the information you provide or add you as collaborator, so you can add and edit yourself. Please write an email to rottler(a)uni-potsam.de or martinsd(a)uni-potsdam.de
