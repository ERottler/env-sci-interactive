# Interactive Team Environmental Science

In recent years, the potential of interactive web tools to share information is increasingly recognized and used in the scientific community. Researchers need to further harness this potential and develop easy accessible online tools that can be used in- and outside the scientific community to explore, learn, teach and communicate environmentally relevant topics. This repository stores code of a Shiny dashboard that provides an overview of scientifically engineered online tools developed at the Institute of Environmental Sciences, University of Potsdam.
